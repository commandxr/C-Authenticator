# C-Authenticator
A authenticator that uses the users PC name to login.
Must have the raw pastebin link inside the code for it to work
PC names inside the pastebin link must be letter-for-letter & it is case-sensitive
If you have questions dm me on instagram @commandxr
There is an example "example.cs" if you get stuck
